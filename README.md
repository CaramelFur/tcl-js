# tcl-js
### A native javascript tcl interpreter

This a port of [tcl.js](https://github.com/cyanogilvie/Tcl.js) to NodeJs

I can not guarantee that everything works as it should, and the api will probably still change.
Therefore it is not recommended  use this package in production yet.

But it would be highly appreciated if this package was heavily tested, cause it is impossible for me to test every scenario.

Currently working tcl commands:
* append
* apply
* array
* break
* catch
* clock
* concat
* continue
* dict
* error
* eval
* expr
* for
* foreach
* if
* incr
* index
* join
* lappend
* lassing
* list
* llength
* lmap
* lrange
* lrepeat
* lreverse
* proc
* return
* set
* split
* string
* switch
* throw
* try
* unset
* while
